1. Write a Java program to create a class called Rectangle with private instance variables length and width. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify these variables.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();


        rectangle.setWidth(4);
        rectangle.setLength(8);

        System.out.println("The rectangle width is " + rectangle.getWidth()
                + " and the rectangle length is " +  rectangle.getLength());

public class Rectangle {

    private int length;
    private int width;

    public int getLength() {
        return length;
    }

    public int getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    public void setLength(int length) {
        this.length = length;
    }

    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
    }
}
2. Write a Java program to create a class called Circle with a private instance variable radius. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the radius variable. However, provide two methods called calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter() that return the calculated area and perimeter based on the current radius value.
   // you can use Math.PI for the area and perimeter.

   public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    Circle circle = new Circle();

            circle.setRadius(12);

            System.out.println("If the Circle radius is " + circle.getRadius()
                    + " then the Aria is " + circle.calculateArea()
                    + " and the Perimeter is " + circle.calculatePerimeter());
    }
    }

public class Circle {

    private double radius;

    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }

    public void setRadius(int radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double calculateArea(){
        double area = 0;
        double p = 3.14;
        area = p * (radius * radius);
        return area;
    }

    public double calculatePerimeter(){
        double perimeter = 0;
        double p = 3.14;
        perimeter = 2 * p * radius;
        return perimeter;
    }
}

3. Write a Java program to create a class called Animal with a method called makeSound(). Create a subclass called Dog that overrides the makeSound() method to bark.
   // Animal can print "animal makes sound"
   // Dog can print "barking..."

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Animal animal = new Animal();
        Dog dog = new Dog();

        System.out.println("The " + animal.makeSound() + " but the Dog is " + dog.makeSound());
    }

public class Animal {

    public String makeSound(){
        return "animal makes sound";
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {

    @Override
    public String makeSound(){
        return "barking...";
    }
}

4. Write a Java program to create a class called Vehicle with a method called drive(). Create a subclass called Car that overrides the drive() method to print "Driving a car".

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Car car = new Car();

        System.out.println("The class Car with method drive prints " + car.drive());
    }

public class Vehicle {

    public String drive(){
        return "";
    }
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public String drive(){
        return "Driving a car";
    }
}

5. Write a Java program to create a class known as "BankAccount" with methods called deposit() and withdraw(). Create a subclass called SavingsAccount that overrides the withdraw() method to prevent withdrawals if the account balance falls below one hundred.

6. Write a Java program to create a vehicle class hierarchy. The base class should be Vehicle, with subclasses Truck, Car and Motorcycle. Each subclass should have properties such as make, model, year, and fuel type. Implement methods for calculating fuel efficiency, distance traveled, and maximum speed.

7. Write a Java program to create a class known as Person with methods called getFirstName() and getLastName(). Create a subclass called Employee that adds a new method named getEmployeeId() and overrides the getLastName() method to include the employee's job title.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Person person = new Person();
        Employee employee = new Employee();

        person.getFirstName();
        person.getLastName();
        employee.getEmployeeId();
        employee.getLastName();
    }

public class Person {

    public void getFirstName(){
        System.out.println("Candidate First name is John");

    }

    public void getLastName(){
        System.out.println("Candidate Last name is Smith");

    }
}

public class Employee extends Person {

    public void getEmployeeId(){
        System.out.println("The Employee ID is 123 ");

    }

    @Override
    public void getLastName(){
        System.out.println("Employee's job title is Java Developer");

    }

}

8. Design a class hierarchy for geometric shapes. Create a base class Shape with methods to calculate area and perimeter. Then, create subclasses for specific shapes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Override the area and perimeter calculation methods for each shape.
